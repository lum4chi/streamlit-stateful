# Streamlit stateful widgets
Wrappers around streamlit widgets to hide state management.

Goal of this widget collection is to effortlessy use widgets that need stateful interaction, like:
- preserving a value while navigating the app and changing pages;
- solving clicking twice to make a setting [_stick_](https://docs.streamlit.io/knowledge-base/using-streamlit/widget-updating-session-state);
- variables set via session state are write-protected from streamlit and duplicating it avoid collisions with session state API
  and prevent warning/errors like:  
    - `The widget with key "<your key>" was created with a default value but also had its value set via the Session State API.`
    - `StreamlitAPIException st.session_state.<var> cannot be modified after the widget with key <var> is instantiated.`

## Usage
This library contains drop-in replacement for standard streamlit widget. So, you can simply swap them like:

```python
import streamlit as st

agree = stateful_checkbox('I agree', key='checkbox')

if agree:
    st.write('Great!')
```

Now you can access you're state looking using `agree`, that is silently linked to `st.session_state['agree.value']`.

You can check each widget in-line documentation to understand it's state management.

This library is under development, please be aware that something can change!
